# Amazon MENA — Reimbursement Reporting & Cost Reduction (Case Study)

**Role:** Reimbursement Program Manager (transitioned from Senior Business Analyst)  
**Period:** 2023 (Business Optimization Stage)  
**Region:** Amazon MENA (Worldwide Emerging Markets)  
**Impact:** **61% YoY reduction** in reimbursement costs; framework **adopted as the EM standard**

---

## Executive Summary

During rapid marketplace growth, reimbursement costs (losses, damages, fraud, and process gaps) escalated to leadership attention. I **engineered and implemented a cross‑functional reimbursement reporting system** that unified data from Delivery, Warehouse, Security/Loss Prevention, and Customer Service, mapped faults to a **“successful order journey”**, and enabled **programmatic corrective actions**. The system delivered a **61% YoY reduction** in reimbursement costs and was **standardised across Amazon’s Worldwide Emerging Markets**.

---

## 1) What

A comprehensive **Reimbursement Reporting & Analytics** framework that:
- Centralised cross‑functional data into a **single source of truth**.
- Quantified **cost drivers** and **fault attribution** along the order journey.
- Enabled **program design**, **tracking**, and **accountability** across teams.
- Fed **KPIs and dashboards** directly into Business Reviews.

---

## 2) Why

- **Growth pressure:** Blitz‑scale growth created **cost gaps** (losses, damages, fraud indicators).
- **Distributed ownership:** Reimbursement drivers weren’t the fault of one team; they emerged across **multiple functions** (Delivery, Warehouse, CS, Security/LP).  
- **Visibility & actionability gap:** Legacy reporting was fragmented and lagging; leadership needed **timely, actionable, and owner‑aligned** insights to drive down costs and protect profitability.

---

## 3) When

- **2023**, as Amazon MENA moved from a growth-first phase to a **profitability and operational excellence** phase.

---

## 4) Who

- **Lead:** Me (Reimbursement Program Manager; previously Senior Business Analyst).  
- **Stakeholders:** Delivery Ops, Fulfilment/Warehouse, Security & Loss Prevention, Customer Service, Finance/Controllership, Marketplace leadership.  
- **Outcome:** Direct collaboration across all functions provided a **360° view** of the business and accelerated cross‑team adoption.

---

## 5) Where

- **Amazon MENA** — with the framework **adopted as the standard** across **Worldwide Emerging Markets**.

---

## 6) Using What (Stack & Methods)

- **Data & Pipelines:** SQL, ETL (scheduled jobs), source integrations from Delivery, Warehouse, CS, Security/LP.  
- **Analytics:** Root Cause Analysis, **Fault Attribution**, KPI engineering, anomaly detection, trend/run‑rate analysis.  
- **Reporting:** Excel for ops handoffs; BI dashboards (e.g., QuickSight) for leadership and WBR/MBR integrations.

> Note: Concrete AWS components (e.g., S3/Redshift/Athena) are typical in Amazon stacks; this case study focuses on the **methods and outcomes** rather than proprietary implementation details.

---

## 7) How (Approach & Design)

### 7.1 Define the “Successful Order Journey”
Create a canonical path from **Placement → Fulfilment → Carrier Handover → Delivery → Return (if any)** and mark **failure modes** that trigger reimbursements.
- **Examples:** “Damaged in FC,” “Lost in transit,” “Customer return not received,” “Incorrect item,” “Fraud indicators.”

### 7.2 Build ETLs and Unify the Source of Truth
- Join **order‑level events** and **disposition codes** from Delivery/Warehouse/CS/LP.
- Standardise reason codes and map to **owner domains** (Delivery, FC, CS, LP, *Multiple*).
- Maintain **granular history** for trend, seasonality, and program attribution.

### 7.3 Engineer KPIs and Fault Attribution
- **Reimbursement Rate (RR):** reimbursements / orders  
- **Reimbursement Cost per Order (RCO):** cost / orders  
- **Driver Mix:** % of cost by reason/owner domain  
- **Program ROI:** cost avoided vs. intervention cost  
- Attribute each event to the **most probable owner domain** using deterministic rules (reason codes, timestamps, scan/chain‑of‑custody events) + threshold logic; fall back to **shared accountability** when signals conflict.

### 7.4 Make It Actionable (from reporting → decisions)
- **Owner-aligned scorecards** per function and site (FCs, lanes, 3P carriers).  
- **Heatmaps** to spotlight high‑leverage problems (by node, route, seller cohort, ASIN class).  
- **Weekly Business Review** integration: clear **targets**, **variance narration**, and **next actions**.

### 7.5 Track Programs to Closure
- Convert insights into **program backlogs** (loss‑prevention audits, packaging standards, carrier route fixes, FC handling SOP refreshers, seller education, etc.).  
- **Before/after** studies with guardrails; monitor **lagged effects** and confounders; attribute **cost avoided** over time.

## 8) Example Analytics (Illustrative SQL)

> Pseudonymised and simplified to convey the approach.

```sql
-- Driver mix by owner domain (monthly)
WITH r AS (
  SELECT
    date_trunc('month', event_ts) AS month,
    owner_domain,                 -- e.g., 'DELIVERY', 'WAREHOUSE', 'CS', 'LP', 'MULTIPLE'
    SUM(reimbursement_cost) AS cost,
    COUNT(*) AS events
  FROM reimbursements_unified
  WHERE region = 'MENA'
  GROUP BY 1,2
),
o AS (
  SELECT
    date_trunc('month', order_ts) AS month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS orders
  FROM orders
  WHERE region = 'MENA'
  GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
  r.month,
  r.owner_domain,
  r.cost,
  r.events,
  o.orders,
  r.cost::decimal / NULLIF(o.orders,0) AS rco,     -- Reimbursement Cost per Order
  r.events::decimal / NULLIF(o.orders,0) AS rr     -- Reimbursement Rate
FROM r
JOIN o USING (month)
ORDER BY r.month, r.owner_domain;
